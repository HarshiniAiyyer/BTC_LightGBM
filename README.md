Accommodating supervised learning algorithms for the historical prices of the world's favorite cryptocurrency and boosting it through LightGBM.

LightGBM is a gradient boosting algorithm that is based on decision tree learning algorithms. Boosting algorithms include generating and detecting weak learners and then combining all of them to form one strong entity. To increase the accuracy of the data set, they are joined together to form a stronger learning attribute. 
This code snippet has also compared the different types of modes of LightGBM and effectiveness of these models on the dataset.
